# Local Library Catalog

An Express.js app that adds, deletes, edits, and displays library catalog information such as books, authors, genres, and book copies from a MongoDB database.

Inspired by the [Express 105: Forms and Deployment assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/express-105-forms-and-deployment) as part of the curriculum for the [NodeJS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
